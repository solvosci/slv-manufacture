Enables addding custom quantities for an unbuild that comes from a BoM.
It's also possible adding new components (that have to belong to a BoM as a
BoM line) and even unbuild product itself.

Optionally, it's possible to automatically update total unbuild quantity when
custom quantities are updated.
